Perfect! The contract is now successfully deployed and verified on the Fuji Testnet. Let's test the complete workflow by uploading a PDF and verifying it:

## 1. Test the Upload Endpoint

First, let's test the upload functionality to make sure it can store files on IPFS and record hashes on the blockchain:

```bash
# Create a test PDF file (or use an existing one)
echo "This is a test PDF file for SEO analysis" > test.pdf

# Test the upload endpoint using curl
curl -X POST \
  -F "file=@test.pdf" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/pinata/upload
```

Alternatively, you can test this through your frontend application if you have an upload form.

## 2. Test the Verification Endpoint

After uploading, test the verification endpoint with the same file:

```bash
# Test the verification endpoint
curl -X POST \
  -F "file=@test.pdf" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/verifyReport
```

## 3. Check the Results

You should get responses like these:

**For successful upload:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cid": "Qm...",
  "ipfsUrl": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qm...",
  "hash": "0x...",
  "txHash": "0x...",
  "blockNumber": 123456,
  "pinataUrl": "https://app.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qm...",
  "network": {
    "chainId": 43113,
    "name": "unknown"
  }
}
```

**For successful verification:**

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "hash": "0x...",
  "network": {
    "chainId": 43113,
    "chainIdHex": "0xa869",
    "name": "unknown"
  }
}
```

## 4. Verify on the Blockchain Explorer

You can also check the transaction on the Fuji Testnet block explorer:

1. Go to https://testnet.snowtrace.io/
2. Paste your transaction hash from the upload response
3. You should see the transaction details and confirm it was successful

## 5. Test with Different Files

Try uploading different files to ensure the system works correctly:

1. Upload a file and verify it immediately - should return `valid: true`
2. Upload a different file and verify it - should return `valid: false` (unless it was previously uploaded)
3. Verify a file that was never uploaded - should return `valid: false`

## 6. Check Your Frontend Integration

If you have a frontend application:

1. Test the upload functionality through your UI
2. Test the verification functionality through your UI
3. Ensure the PDF generation is working correctly

## 7. Monitor for Any Issues

Watch for these potential issues:

1. **Pinata upload failures**: Check your Pinata API credentials
2. **Blockchain transaction failures**: Ensure you have enough test AVAX for gas fees
3. **Verification mismatches**: Make sure you're using the exact same file for upload and verification

## 8. Celebrate Your Success! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully:

- Deployed a smart contract to the Avalanche Fuji Testnet
- Set up a system to upload files to IPFS via Pinata
- Created a mechanism to store file hashes on the blockchain
- Built a verification system to check if files have been registered

Your decentralized document verification system is now fully functional!

If you encounter any issues during testing, let me know and I'll help you troubleshoot them.
